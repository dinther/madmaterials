# Beatline - Gradient

I wanted a gradient material that uses color stops just like we have in CSS. I figured 6 color stops would cover the wildest combinations.
However, in order to make animating the gradients easier I added a width parameter to each color stop.

A gradient to the next color stop only takes place in the gap remaining between color stops after the solid color part for the width has been allocated.
