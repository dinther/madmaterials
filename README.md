## MadMapper Materials collection

This repository contains my growing collection of MadMapper materials to drive Video, Lasers and Moving heads.

## Installation

MadMapper material l;ibrary is stored in

```
%appdata%\MadMapper\MadMapper\Library\Materials

Copy all the folders in this repository into there and restart MadMapper. 
Note that some Materials are actually FX programs that only show up in the UI wehn you wish to apply certain special effects to your material.
